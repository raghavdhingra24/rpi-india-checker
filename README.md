# rpi-india-checker
A project to check the availability of Raspberry Pi boards in India on several Official and Unofficial sites

This script was created by me a few months back when I wanted to buy a Raspberry Pi and due to shortage it was very hard to keep a track of availability of these boards on several websites.\
It is a Python script using Beautiful Soup and requests library.\
It currently checks the following sites:
- Official Sites
  - Robocraze
  - SilverlineElectronics
  - FactoryForward
  - Thingbits
- Unofficial Sites
  - CrazyPi
  - Embeddinator

Note: This is just a script checking the availability of RPi boards and I am neither affiliated with Raspberry Pi Organisation nor any of these websites.
